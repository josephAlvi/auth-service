# auth-service
this is one of the early versions/prototypes of a microservice that I developed on a previous role. Its a node microservice that provides api calls for using Authorize.Net card payment gateway service (http://www.authorize.net/)

it wrappped up the Authorize.Net API calls as per needed on frontend of that project. 

The keys used are masked in the code. you will need your account with Authorize.Net to be able to use keys and api.
